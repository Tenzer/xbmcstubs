XBMC Stubs
==========

These files can help you to develop a script or an addon for [Kodi (XBMC)](http://kodi.tv/) Media Center. Use them in your favorite IDE to enable autocompletion of function, class and method names and access docstrings for each function, class and method.

Typically, a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) allows you add a "source directory" containing the xbmcstubs files to your development project. Then you will be able to "import" the modules as you normally would in Python.

Note that xbmcstubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code, so please don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into xbmcstubs.
